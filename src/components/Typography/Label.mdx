# Label

**Note!!!** In web environment sometimes you need to wrap `Label` in a `<Box>` or provide a parent node with `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` for centering to work properly. In React Native it is non issue because all nodes be default have these properties

### Usage

<Playground>
  <Box>
    <Label>Lorem ipsum dolar set amet</Label>
  </Box>
</Playground>
