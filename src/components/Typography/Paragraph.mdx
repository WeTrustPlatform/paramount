# Paragraph

Composes React Native's `Text` component (i.e. you can pass its props)

**Note!!!** In web environment sometimes you need to wrap `Paragraph` in a `<Box>` or provide a parent node with `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` for centering to work properly. In React Native it is non issue because all nodes be default have these properties

### Usage

<Playground>
  <Box>
    <Paragraph
      color="primary"
      align="left"
      size="large" // small - large or number
      fontFamily="text"
      weight="normal"
      getStyles={(props, theme) => ({
        paragraphStyle: {},
      })}
    >
      Lorem ipsum dolar set amet
    </Paragraph>
  </Box>
</Playground>

### Sizes

<Playground>
  <Box flexDirection="column">
    <Paragraph size="small">Lorem ipsum dolar set amet</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph size="medium">Lorem ipsum dolar set amet</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph size="large">Lorem ipsum dolar set amet</Paragraph>
  </Box>
</Playground>
