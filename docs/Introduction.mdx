- **Cross platform.** Components work on both React Native And React Web platforms (using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web))
- **Fully customizable.** You can customize 100% of the component styles so that you can adapt to your branding needs of a product.
- **Mobile friendly.** All of the components are usable and look good on mobile devices.
