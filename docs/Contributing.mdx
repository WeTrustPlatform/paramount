## Pull requests

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/paramount
   cd paramount
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/WeTrustPlatform/paramount
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Install/update dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Create a new topic branch (off the `master` branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```
