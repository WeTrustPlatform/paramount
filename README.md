# Goals

Cross platform React Native and React Web UI components library

- **Cross platform.** Components work on both React Native And React Web platforms (using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web))
- **Fully customizable.** You can customize 100% of the component styles so that you can adapt to your branding needs any way you want.
- **Mobile friendly.** All of the components are usable and look good on mobile devices.

More:

- Built on TypeScript (typings!)
- Tree-shaking friendly (ESM)
- Server-side rendering friendly
- Accessibility available (You can pass accessibility props on all touchable components)
- [Styles in JavaScript](https://twitter.com/necolas/status/1058949412284592128)
