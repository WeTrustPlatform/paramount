# Paramount

Cross platform React Native and React Web UI components library

- **Fully customizable.** You can customize 100% of the component styles so that you can adapt to your branding needs any way you want.
- **Mobile friendly.** All of the components are usable and look good on mobile devices.

More:

- Built on TypeScript (typings!)
- Tree-shaking friendly (ESM)
- Server-side rendering friendly
- Accessibility available (You can pass accessibility props on all touchable components)
